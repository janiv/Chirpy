# Chirpy, a Boot.dev Guided Project
This repo is my completed version of Boot.dev's Chirpy project that is meant to
teach students about Web Servers. If you are a fellow student, copy my code at
your own risk. I am ingeniously stupid at times.


## Running the project
To run this project you need to have Go, Postgres, SQLC, and Goose installed.
You will also have to create a .env file with the following fields:
- DB_URL= 
- JWT_SECRET= 
- POLKA_KEY=
- PLATFORM="dev"
